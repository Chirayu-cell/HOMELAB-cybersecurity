Quick next steps I recommend (so these templates become usable)

1. Replace <REPLACE_ME> placeholders (passwords, hostnames).

2. Create the indexes in Splunk (windows, sysmon, network) or change index= values to your existing ones.

3. On pfSense GUI, implement the interfaces and firewall rule templates. Use the notes to create OpenVPN rather than exposing ports publicly.

4. For Sysmon, create a sysmon-config.xml (I can generate one for you next — say if you want the full Sysmon XML with rules for detection).

5. Snapshot VMs before experimenting.
